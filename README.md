- 👋 Hi, I’m @harrupgu a last year PhD Student in a program called InnovaXN. https://www.innovaxn.eu/
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D image analysis and recently very interested in the use of artificial intelligence in 3D imaging and materials science  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to perform multiple 3D imaging techniques and processing using Neural Networks and more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the field and with anyone. Please ask me and if I can't find the solution I might help you doing something else.
